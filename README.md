Created an accident analysis report using Power BI involves several steps, including data preparation, modeling, and visualization. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you understand how to create an accident analysis report using Power BI.

# Power BI Implementation Steps:-
Import Data: Load your accident dataset into Power BI Desktop.

Data Cleaning: Use Power Query to clean and transform the data.

Modeling: Establish relationships and create necessary measures using DAX.

Visualization: Design interactive reports and dashboards with various visuals.

Publish & Share: Publish the report to Power BI Service for sharing with stakeholders.

# Data Transformation :
Convert data types as necessary (e.g., dates, categories).

Create calculated columns or measures, such as Accident Frequency, Severity Index, or Weather Impact Score.

Sample Data Fields:-

Date : Date and time of the accident.

Location : Geographic location or coordinates.

Severity : Classification (e.g., Minor, Major, Fatal).

Cause : Identified cause of the accident (e.g., Speeding, Distracted Driving).

Weather Conditions : Weather at the time of the accident.

Vehicle Type : Type of vehicles involved.

Injuries/Fatalities : Number of injuries or fatalities.

Accident Overview Dashboard : Display total accidents, accident types, and severity distribution using cards and pie charts.

Trend Analysis : Use line charts to visualize accident trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

Geographical Analysis: Utilize maps to show accident hotspots and analyze location-based patterns.

Cause Analysis: Bar charts to identify the most common causes of accidents.

Weather Impact: Analyze the influence of weather conditions on accident occurrence using heatmaps or scatter plots.

# 🔍Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):-
Total Current Year Casualties.

Total Current Year Accidents.

Current Year Fatal Casualties.

Current Year Serious Casualties.

Current Year Slight Casualties.

Calculated some visualizations are  Casualties by Location, Casualties by Vehicle type, Current Year Casualties by Road type, Current Year Casualties by Urban/Rural, Current Year Casualties by Light Conditions.



# 📊 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:

- 📈 Total Casualties Analysis: 417,883 casualties over two years.
- 🗓️ Peak Months: October and November saw the highest casualties. 
- 🚔 Casualties by Vehicle Type: Car accidents accounted for 79.8% of total casualties. 
- 🤕 Accident Severity: Slight severity casualties formed 84.1%, with fatal severity at only 1.7%. 
- 🛣️ Road Type Analysis: Single carriageway roads had the maximum casualties.
- 🛣️ Road Surface: 67% of casualties occurred on dry road surfaces.
- 📍Area/Location: Urban areas accounted for 61% of casualties.
- 💡Light Condition: 73% of casualties occurred in daylight conditions.

# 💡 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 :

1. Enhance road safety measures during high-risk periods (October and November).
2. Focus on awareness campaigns and monitoring for car drivers.
3. Improve and upgrade single carriageway roads.
4. Target urban areas with specific interventions, especially during daylight conditions.
5. Enhance road maintenance and surface improvements.

# 🛠️Tools Used: 
Power BI Desktop, Power Query, DAX.

# Outcome: 
Interactive dashboards with actionable insights for safety improvement and accident prevention strategies.
