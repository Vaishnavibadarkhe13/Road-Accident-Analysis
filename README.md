Created an accident analysis report using Power BI involves several steps, including data preparation, modeling, and visualization. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you understand how to create an accident analysis report using Power BI.

# Power BI Implementation Steps:-
Import Data: Load your accident dataset into Power BI Desktop.

Data Cleaning: Use Power Query to clean and transform the data.

Modeling: Establish relationships and create necessary measures using DAX.

Visualization: Design interactive reports and dashboards with various visuals.

Publish & Share: Publish the report to Power BI Service for sharing with stakeholders.

# Data Transformation :
Convert data types as necessary (e.g., dates, categories).

Create calculated columns or measures, such as Accident Frequency, Severity Index, or Weather Impact Score.

Sample Data Fields:-

Date : Date and time of the accident.

Location : Geographic location or coordinates.

Severity : Classification (e.g., Minor, Major, Fatal).

Cause : Identified cause of the accident (e.g., Speeding, Distracted Driving).

Weather Conditions : Weather at the time of the accident.

Vehicle Type : Type of vehicles involved.

Injuries/Fatalities : Number of injuries or fatalities.

Accident Overview Dashboard : Display total accidents, accident types, and severity distribution using cards and pie charts.

Trend Analysis : Use line charts to visualize accident trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

Geographical Analysis: Utilize maps to show accident hotspots and analyze location-based patterns.

Cause Analysis: Bar charts to identify the most common causes of accidents.

Weather Impact: Analyze the influence of weather conditions on accident occurrence using heatmaps or scatter plots.

# üîçKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):-
Total Current Year Casualties.

Total Current Year Accidents.

Current Year Fatal Casualties.

Current Year Serious Casualties.

Current Year Slight Casualties.

Calculated some visualizations are  Casualties by Location, Casualties by Vehicle type, Current Year Casualties by Road type, Current Year Casualties by Urban/Rural, Current Year Casualties by Light Conditions.

# üõ†Ô∏èTools Used: 
Power BI Desktop, Power Query, DAX.

# Outcome: 
Interactive dashboards with actionable insights for safety improvement and accident prevention strategies.
